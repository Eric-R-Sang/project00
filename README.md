This is a website about myself. There are 4 html files (index.html, activities.html, interests.html, and resume.html). There are also two stylesheets (styles.css and stylesheet.css). All of the jpg's were the images included in the carousels, and the images titled page1-4.jpg/png are the resume images on the resume page. Each file besides the resume file has the same basic template applied: a carousel at the beginning, a small area for text, and then a footer. All of the files also have a responsive, sticky navbar at the top.
The index.html file is my home page. It contains a carousel of images that are important to me, a small welcome section, a connection section, and a footer.
The activities.html file is a page that lists all of the school activities that I am affiliated in. The carousel for this page has captions. This page is the one I chose to include a table for.
The interests.html file lists my hobbies. After the carousel, the page is simply text.
Finally, the resume.html file is a page with 4 images (one for each page of my old resume). After the four images, I implemented a pdf button that brings the user to a PDF download screen.
