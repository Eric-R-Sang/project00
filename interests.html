                    <p class="lead">I have currently been taking guitar lessons for about 1.5 years (began in March 2019). I would say that I am currrently at an intermediate level, meaning that I can compose some simple songs, that I have knowledge of basic music theory, and that I have memorised a majority of the basic chord shapes and scales. I have also learned a few songs, such as "Here Comes the Sun," "Dust in the Wind," and "BlackBird." Aside from the guitar, I also used to play the violin. I had a total of 5 years of active violin playing before switching over to the guitar.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I have taken a strong interest towards coding and physics during my high school career. In fact, I decided to focus mainly on these two subject areas by taking all of the AP Physics courses that my school offers and by taking a majority of the Computer Science that my school offers. The reason this website even exists is because I have taken an interest towards computer languages. I believe that one, or both, of these two fields will be my field of profession in the future.</p>

Games that I have played include a variety of Pokemon games, League of Legends, Minecraft, CS:GO, and Fortnite to name a few. As a "gamer," I have found that I am fairly decent at a few games. For example, I am pretty highly ranked in League of Legends. While I am interested in video games, I still realize that I have other priorities. Therefore, I have been able to balance this hobby with my other hobbies, with my schoolwork, and with my extracurriculars.</p>

This is why I have chosen to take part in many medical extracurriculars, such as Medicine Club. I find that I am particularly inclined to the human brain. More precisely though, I am inclined ot learn about my own brain. I want to know why I know the things I know, why I might be more or less apt than somebody else, and why I am who I am. I imagine that I might pursue some classes to further my knowledge on the human psyche, but I don't think that I will pursue a full blown career.</p>
